        <h3>What?</h3>
        <p>We have created a portal that aids the citizens in becoming self- dependent, especially the ones the rural areas. The portal gives the user information about what he can do with the resources he/she has. The website will also tell about various schemes that will make a particular field more profitable for a common man. We kept in mind to make it as user-friendly as possible so that nobody faces any issues while using it.</p>
